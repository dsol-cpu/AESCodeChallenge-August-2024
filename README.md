This was a code challenge project done for AES in order to:
* Parse dirty JSON containing location names and corresponding longitude/latitude values
* Map them to a globe
* Represent them in an interesting way

Solution:
* I decided to parse with a regex to catch all cases in the dirty JSON
* used Unity Jobs and the Burst compiler to render and dynamically rotate all pins on the globe

Tools used: Unity, C#, Blender
